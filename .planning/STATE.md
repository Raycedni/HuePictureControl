# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-14)

**Core value:** Accurate, low-latency color synchronization from an HDMI source to Hue lights — especially gradient-capable devices that existing solutions don't properly support.
**Current focus:** Phase 17 — WLED Backend and Streaming (next)

## Current Position

Phase: 16 (zone-persistence-bug-fixes) — COMPLETE
Plan: 3 of 3 complete
Status: Phase 16 shipped; next up Phase 17 (WLED Backend and Streaming)
Last activity: 2026-04-20 -- Phase 16 plan 03 completed (all 3 plans shipped)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 3 (Phase 16 full)
- Average duration: ~30 min / plan
- Total execution time: ~1.5 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 16 | 3 | ~1.5h | ~30 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 16-01 (backend DB + router), 16-02 (broadcaster + streaming service), 16-03 (frontend store + LightPanel)
- Trend: steady; Phase 16 executed cleanly across both backend and frontend

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [16-03]: LightPanel uses a 3-tier zone selection cascade (streaming > camera-persisted > configs[0]) with guard-clause early returns inside a single useEffect
- [16-03]: Stale-persisted configs fall back silently AND overwrite the dangling row via putLastZone (Claude's Discretion per 16-CONTEXT.md)
- [16-03]: W2 closure — pre-selection is read-only; verified by explicit `not.toHaveBeenCalled()` negative assertion
- [16-03]: W3 closure — zone `<select>` carries data-testid="zone-select"; tests use findByTestId/getByTestId instead of index-based querySelectorAll
- [v1.3 roadmap]: WLED streaming uses stdlib socket (UDP) — no new library; DRGB for <=490 LEDs, DNRGB for >490 (auto-selected by WledService)
- [v1.3 roadmap]: WLED device registration uses existing httpx to fetch /json/info from device IP before persisting
- [v1.3 roadmap]: WLED channels use shared channel abstraction — painted ranges appear in light panel alongside Hue segments, same drag-drop assignment
- [v1.3 roadmap]: HA endpoints are unauthenticated thin adapters over the existing StreamingCoordinator — no new auth layer
- [v1.3 roadmap]: Phase 16 (bug fixes) runs first as warm-up — independent of WLED, unblocks clean state for WLED testing

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 3.1 inserted after Phase 3: Auto-Mapping from Entertainment Config — auto-generate screen regions from channel positions before building manual canvas editor (user decision 2026-03-24)
- v1.3 Phases 16-19 added 2026-04-14: Zone persistence fixes, WLED backend+streaming, HA control endpoints, WLED strip paint UI
- v1.1 archived 2026-04-14: 5 phases, 10 plans, 7 requirements left unchecked (known gaps)
- Phase 16 closed 2026-04-20: 3 plans, BFIX-01 + BFIX-02 shipped

### Blockers/Concerns

(None — Phase 16 clean close; ready for Phase 17 kickoff)
